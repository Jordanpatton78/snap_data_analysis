# Snap Data Analysis

The following is the code I used for the analysis I did for the BI engineer application for Snap Finance. For tasks 1-4, I just have sql queries to answer the given questions and get data for the visualizations.

For task 5, I used advanced machine learning techniques (SBERT and clustering) to analyze approval rate and amounts approved by job category, with the job categories being determined by semantic similarity as determined by a transformer encoder model, and the names of the clusters being determined by a decoder LLM (large language model).

All visualizations can be found at this Looker project: https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/166d3a1e-37cb-43c2-a786-a4b5455dd8a8

Note: If you want to see my code and the jupyter notebook isn't showing up in GitHub, download it and open it in VS code or Google Colab.
